# twitter-sentiment-analysis and word corpus using R
analyse sentiment of a tweet as negative or positive.



you need twitter developer account credentials. we are going to use twitter-dev API.

after getting credentials store them in text file.

first : word corpus
word corpus is like word cloud consisting of diffrent words about a topic (or a #hashtag). bigger the word in size, higher the ocurancce of word about that #hashtag.

Second : twitter sentiment analysis

 

we have created bag of words. positivewords.txt and negative-words.txt

we search tweets by a key-word, parse all the tweets and analyze every word (of course not including stop-words).

if there are 5 negative words, and 2 positive, tweet's net polarity is negative with intensity 5/7.


how to execute? :

run the uploaded R script in rstudio if posibble. if exeuted line by line, it would be better for understanding.
