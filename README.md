# twitter-sentiment-analysis
analyse sentiment of a tweet as negative or positive.



you need twitter developer account credentials. we are going to use twitter-dev API.

after getting credentials store them in text file.

and run the uploaded R script 

we have created bag of words. positivewords.txt and negative-words.txt

we search tweets by a key-word, parse all the tweets and analyze every word (of course not including stop-words).

if there are 5 negative words, and 2 positive, tweet's net polarity is negative with intensity 5/7.
